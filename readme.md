# NVIM

How is it different from all the great setups out there?

- No file explorer/tree plugins; they all have their flaws and netrw is actually
  quite effective (with just few more ergonomic keymaps) and being native to Vim,
  it causes no performance problems
- No file explorer plugin, use built-in netrw with a few better keymaps for ergonomics
- Paq.nvim as package manager - simple and predictable, no lazy loading
- No bullshit plugins like animations, highly experimental slow UI plugins etc.
- No terminal support/plugins whatsoever; we are not trying to build terminal 
  emulator/manager here, there are tools that do this very well already, 
  supporting tabs, panes, keymaps, configs, etc. I'd recommend Windows Terminal 
  for Windows users, and for MacOS and UNIX I'm sure you have all kinds of great 
  tools to choose from.
