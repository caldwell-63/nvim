# NVIM

How is it different from all the great setups out there?

- No file explorer/tree plugins; they all have their flaws and netrw is actually
  quite effective (with just a few additional keymaps for ergonomics) and being 
  native to Vim, its performance is flawless
- Simple and predictable `paq.nvim` package manager; no lazy loading
- No bullshit plugins featuring animations, highly experimental slow UI plugins etc
- No terminal support/plugins whatsoever; we are not trying to build terminal 
  emulator/manager here, there are tools that do this very well already, 
  supporting tabs, panes, keymaps, configs, etc, I'd recommend wezterm
- No compatibility with Windows guaranteed at all

## Installation

- Install `paq-nvim` first
- git clone & nvim 

## Keys (`keys.*`)

## `G` | Git

- `<Leader>gi`  `git init`
- `<Leader>gg`  `:wa` `git commit -a -m "_____"`
- `<Leader>gp`  `git push`

## `Y` | Yarn

- `<Leader>yy`  `yarn`
- `<Leader>ya`  `yarn add ____`

## `L` | LSP

Shortcuts around commands provided by `lspconfig`. Useful especially that the LSP
isn't always doing perfectly on its own, for example Lua language server has an
issue when you change a workspace and it needs to be restarted.

- `i` info       `:LspInfo`
- `l` log        `:LspLog`
- `r` restart    `:LspRestart`
- `s` start      `:LspStart`
- `d` stop       `:LspStop`
