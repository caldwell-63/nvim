# NVIM

How is it different from all the great setups out there?

- No file explorer/tree plugins; they all have their flaws and netrw is actually
  quite effective (with just a few additional keymaps for ergonomics) and being 
  native to Vim, its performance is flawless
- Simple and predictable `paq.nvim` package manager; no lazy loading
- No bullshit plugins featuring animations, highly experimental slow UI plugins etc
- No terminal support/plugins whatsoever; we are not trying to build terminal 
  emulator/manager here, there are tools that do this very well already, 
  supporting tabs, panes, keymaps, configs, etc, I'd recommend wezterm
- No compatibility with Windows guaranteed at all
